# Task 06: Deep Fake Interview

## Overview

This project adapts Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2024 insights (Task 05) into a brief AI-generated deepfake interview.  
Two voices, an Interviewer and the Coach, bring the narrative to life in a conversational Q&A format.  
The combined audio was generated with **AIVoice**, and the final video was produced directly from that audio using **AudioCleaner.ai**.

---

## Objectives

- Produce a short (60–90s) deep fake interview video.  
- Use free AI tools (AIVoice + AudioCleaner.ai).  
- Document workflow and reflections in one file.  

---

## Deliverables

- **Final video:** `Video_deepfake_interview.mp4`  
- **Combined audio track:** `Audio_deepfake_interview.mp3`  
- **Script:** Included below

## Interview Script (60–90s)

**A (Interviewer):** Coach, when you look back at this season, what stands out to you most about the team’s journey?  
**B (Coach):** The fight. We had ups and downs, but the players kept competing and showing heart every game.  

**A:** Emma Tyrrell really seemed to spark the offense. How important was her impact?  
**B:** Emma was our go-to. Her consistency gave us confidence and lifted the whole team when we needed it.  

**A:** Draw controls were huge this year, with Katie leading that effort. How did that shape games?  
**B:** Possession wins games. Katie’s work gave us chances to control the pace and stay competitive.  

**A:** Offense produced, but sometimes defense was tested. What’s your perspective?  
**B:** We scored plenty, but defense is about discipline. If we tighten that up, close games start turning into wins.  

**A:** And finally, what’s the biggest lesson you’ll carry into next season?  
**B:** Belief and discipline. The talent is there — we just need to sharpen the details to reach the next level.

## Workflow

1. **Script Writing**  
   - Adapted Task 05 findings into a script.   

2. **Audio Generation (AIVoice)**  
   - Generated the entire dialogue in one file (`Audio_deepfake_interview.mp3`).  
   - Used two distinct tones to differentiate Interviewer and Coach.  

3. **Video Generation (AudioCleaner.ai)**  
   - Uploaded `Audio_deepfake_interview.mp3` to **AudioCleaner.ai**.  
   - Tool auto-generated visuals synchronized with the dialogue.  
   - Exported final result as `Video_deepfake_interview.mp4`.

## Challenges

- **Audio choices:** Using one combined file simplified workflow but reduced flexibility in editing visuals per speaker.  
- **Visuals:** Audio-to-video AI limited control of image timing and style.  
- **Voice pacing:** Early attempts were too fast — re-generated with slower pacing.
